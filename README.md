We were going to the Splash Screen Tutorial from The Flutter Way YouTube. 

Onboarding Screen - Complete E-Commerce App Flutter UI - Ep 1 - Speed Code

Things that I learned. 

1) Makes sure that you have your Scaffold Widget around the SplashScreen Main Page. If you do not start out with the Scaffold Widget, you will get yellow underlines under the text that you want to use. Also, there is no background color and the font is not applied. 

2) I really impressed with the PageView.builder Widget. It really makes life easier. 

3) This tutorial in creating a Splash Screen is a great reference when you need to replicate a Splash Screen. 

4) The Route looks like a really quick and easy way to keep track of the pages that you use. 

I am looking forward to posting more of my tutorials and reflections if it helps you get pointed in the right place to learn.
